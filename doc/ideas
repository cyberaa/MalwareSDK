Network Obfuscate module:
  hooks into network_stack and obfuscates/encrypts code before it is sent over the wire. e.g. use C&C server's public key to encrypt traffic.

When developing OS module. Before any subprocess is executed, send an interupt to the rootkit module and wait for permission to execute - i.e. if we exec /bin/bash, coordinate with the rootkit so that we spawn our shell, and give the pid to the rootkit for hiding.

Network API:
  Use REST/JSON for communication.
